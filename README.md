HOW IT WORKS:

A user who initially opens the app is introduced to the login page where he/she has to log in using their username and password. On clicking log in, if the username and password are valid, you'll be led to the home page. On entering an invalid username or password, you will be required to retry logging in. If you are a new user using the app for the first time, you can click on the sign-up option which will lead you to the sign-up page where upon entering your details and clicking on the submit option, you'll be added to the database system. You will be required to log in with your new unique username and password. 

The Welcome page has multiple options available for the user to enter his/her details or to view their data. The options available are Appointments, Medicines, Vaccines, Medical History and Family History. If you are a female, there will be an extra option on your home page named Cycle Reminder. 

Upon clicking Appointments, there are three options available, Previous Appointments, Add New Appointments, and Future Appointments. Add New Appointments enables the user to add newly scheduled appointments to the system. Previous Appointments and Future Appointments pages show past appointments of the user and the appointments scheduled for the future respectively. 

Upon clicking Medicines on the home page, you'll be provided with three options namely, Add Medicines, Current Medicines, and Past Records. Add Medicines would allow you to add your new medicine details to your records. Current Medicines helps you view all your medicines due on the current day.
